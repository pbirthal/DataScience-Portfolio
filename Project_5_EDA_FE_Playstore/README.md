# Google Playstore Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering of Google Playstore data. The analysis aims to uncover insights about app categories, installations, ratings, and other interesting facts.

## Key Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Visualization of app trends and statistics

## Libraries Used
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## Highlights
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handled missing values
   - Standardized data formats (e.g., app size, installs, prices)
   - Converted data types for analysis

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Analyzed app categories distribution
   - Investigated top apps by installations
   - Examined rating distributions

3. **Visualizations**:
   - Created pie charts for category distribution
   - Plotted bar graphs for top app categories and installations
   - Generated KDE plots for numerical features

4. **Key Insights**:
   - Identified most popular app categories
   - Analyzed categories with the largest number of installations
   - Explored top apps within specific categories (Games, Communication, Productivity, Social)

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project contains information about apps on the Google Play Store, including details such as category, rating, size, and number of installs.

## Future Work
- Deeper analysis of app pricing strategies
- Investigation of correlations between app features and success metrics
- Time-based analysis of app trends and updates
